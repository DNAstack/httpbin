# This script packages the end-to-end test module into a Docker image that runs the tests against
# an arbitrary deployment of this service, specified by the E2E_TEST_URI environment variable.
# The contents of /target are captured by the CI system after the tests have run, which makes
# report generation possible.

# The Docker image we build is tagged with the string passed in as the first argument to this script.

# This script is invoked during CI build with the following arguments:
target_image_name=$1
app_name=$2
app_version=$3
